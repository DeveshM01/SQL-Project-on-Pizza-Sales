# SQL-Project-on-Pizza-Sales
Hello, I am Devesh Mishra, and this is a summary of my SQL project on analyzing pizza sales data. The project began with data cleaning in Microsoft Excel, where I used various functions to ensure data accuracy and consistency. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats. After cleaning the data, I connected the Excel files to SQL to perform a range of queries from basic to advanced levels to address specific business questions.

## Project Steps and Skills Applied:

# Data Cleaning in Excel:

Functions Used: VLOOKUP, IF, TRIM, CONCATENATE, and various text functions.
Skills Demonstrated: Attention to detail, problem-solving, data wrangling.
Connecting Excel to SQL:

Tool Used: SQL Server, MySQL, or any SQL database that supports Excel integration.
Skills Demonstrated: Technical proficiency, database management.

# Performing SQL Queries:

Basic Queries: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
Intermediate Queries: JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT), GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY.
Advanced Queries: Subqueries, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), window functions, indexing, stored procedures, and triggers.
Skills Demonstrated: Analytical thinking, complex problem-solving, optimization, and automation.

# Problem Statements Addressed:

Customer Analysis: Identified top customers by sales volume and frequency.
Sales Trends: Analyzed monthly sales trends to determine peak periods.
Product Popularity: Determined the most popular pizzas based on order frequency and revenue.
Store Performance: Compared sales performance across different store locations.

# Problem-Solving Skills Highlighted:

Analytical Skills: Breaking down complex data into actionable insights.
Critical Thinking: Addressing business questions with logical and efficient queries.
Technical Skills: Using advanced SQL functions to optimize data retrieval and processing.
Attention to Detail: Ensuring data accuracy and reliability through meticulous cleaning and validation.

This project showcases my ability to handle data end-to-end, from initial cleaning to advanced analysis, using a combination of Excel and SQL to derive meaningful business insights.
